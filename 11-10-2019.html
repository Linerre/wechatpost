        <h1>Retail Worker Still Smarts After Customer's Criticism</h1>
        <p>
            DEAR ABBY: I <ruby>work retail<rt>做零售的</rt></ruby> and have <ruby>bipolar disorder <rt>躁狂忧郁症</rt></ruby>. (I have been stable for nine years.) 
            A few Christmases ago, a customer called me "hateful" because I wished her a Merry Christmas. 
            (She doesn't come into the store anymore.) My manager and co-workers explained that she <ruby>was in a bad mood that day <rt>那天心情不好</rt></ruby> , and it wasn't my fault.<br><br>

            Due to my illness, I am <ruby>obsessed with thoughts that <rt>总是觉得</rt></ruby> it will happen again during the holidays, 
            and I won't know what to say or how to react, or I'll think it's my fault. Worse yet, 
            I no longer want to say Merry Christmas again, although I will try. Do you have any advice in case 
            I get another bad reaction? -- GREETING IN THE EAST<br><br>
            
            DEAR GREETING: You did nothing wrong! When December <ruby><b>rolls around</b> <rt>to arrive or happen again</rt></ruby>, the expressions "Merry Christmas" 
            and "Happy Holidays" are very common. If a customer <ruby>takes offense <rt>感到被冒犯了</rt></ruby>, all you need to reply is, 
            "Excuse me if I offended you." And if you're still worried about this issue, discuss it with your doctor or therapist. 
        </p>
